## 🚀 About Me  

I'm a software developer with **5 years of experience building native iOS applications** used by millions of users while working remotely at Inter Bank.

In 2025, I began a new chapter as a Software Developer for the Government of Goiás, working with **Angular, TypeScript and a Java-based backend** in large-scale public systems — while specializing in **React & React Native**.

My hybrid background (Web + Mobile + iOS) gives me strong skills in **architecture, performance, clean code, UI/UX, reuse, and scalable development**.  
Thanks to my iOS background, transitioning into **React Native** became natural — bringing mobile thinking, layout precision and performance-oriented practices into cross-platform development.
